# Title (replace with your title)

Introductory paragraph (replace this with your text)
In the tutorial, we will be discussing how we use a regex combination to verify and allow all possible letters and numbers within a Hexadeciemal value. A Hexadecimal, often abbreviated as "hex," is a numeral system with a base of 16. It uses sixteen distinct symbols to represent numbers: 0-9 for values 0 to 9 and A-F (or a-f) for values 10 to 15. In this system, each digit's value is determined by its position and weight. So, the lowest number in a hex is 0 while the highest is 'F' or 15.

## Summary

Briefly summarize the regex you will be describing and what you will explain. Include a code snippet of the regex. Replace this text with your summary.

In this particular tutorial however, we will be discussing the regex (regular expression) for a hexadecimal and breakdown each of its components.
Below is the regex code for accepting every possible hexadecimal value.
Matching a Hex Value â€“ [/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/]
We will discuss the anchors, the quantifiers, OR Operators, Character classes and flags in this tutorial.
